<h1 class=bolds class=toppp>Design: How State Compare works!</h1>
<ul class=intro>
    <li>To summarize, our project uses three main folders (includes, public, and templates) as well as a couple other miscellaneous files.
    The number one explanation for how our code works is in the comments of the code itself, which are generally very
    thoroughly done.</li>
    <li>Additional technical explanation for each file can be found on this page.</li>
    <li><span class=bolds>INCLUDES</span>: config.php, constants.php, functions.php</li>
    <li><span class=bolds>PUBLIC</span>: css folder, fonts folder, img folder, js folder, compare.php, design.php, documentation.php,
     ideal.php, index.php, theboys.php</li>
    <li><span class=bolds>TEMPLATES</span>: apology.php, design2.php, documentation2.php, dump.php, footer.php, header.php,
    template.php, template2.php, template3.php, template4.php, template5.php, theboys2.php</li>
    <li><span class=bolds>OTHER</span>: states.csv, states.sql</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Includes</h2>
    <li class=bolds>config.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Borrowed from pset7, includes constants.php and functions.php, and displays errors</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>constants.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Global constants, such as login for server and phpmyadmin</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>functions.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Various functions to assist throughout the website, such as query("SQL commands") borrowed from
        pset7, apologize and dump as well as redirect and render.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Public</h2>
    <li class=bolds>css folder (styles.css)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>All of our css (styling) for the entire project, handles coloring and formatting of our output
        tables, bolding of the words in this document and others, and basic formatting of the homepage
        and padding etc., lots of odds and ends</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>fonts folder</li>
    <ul>
        <li>No significant files, just contains the fonts we use etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>img folder</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Contains the logo at the top of every page, the logos for Ideal, Compare, and some American flags and such.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>js folder</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The only javascript we used for our project was for the sliders, these files configure basic
        javascript of the website.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>index.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Renders template.php, our homepage after configuring the page by requiring config.php.</li> 
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>compare.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The controller for template2.php and template3.php, determines whether a browser is using
        the GET or POST method. If it's GET, then it renders template2.php after using an SQL query to
        construct a list of state names. If it's POST, it takes all the form data from the posted form
        and passes those to template3.php and renders that file in order to display the results the user desires.</li> 
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>ideal.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The controller for template4.php and template5.php, determines whether a browser is using
        the GET or POST method. If it's GET, it renders template4.php. If it's POST, it grabs all the form data
        then errorchecks all these inputs to be sure that all inputs are valid and will not crash template5.php.
        If there are no errors, then it renders template5.php and passes all the values template5 will need.</li> 
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>theboys.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The controller for theboys2.php, if the browser is using GET it sends the user to theboys2.php to see
        the creators and copyright owners of the website, J.Paul and Jake!</li> 
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>documentation.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This is the controller that renders documentation2.php, the php file where we put all our
        project's documentation</li> 
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>design.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The controller that renders design2.php, the php file with all of our design details.</li> 
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Templates</h2>
    <li class=bolds>apology.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Whenever the apologize function is called, this template is rendered with the text given
        to it by apologize("string"). It displays "Sorry!" in red danger text, then the message passed
        into the apologize() function in red, then offers a back button using the javascript:history.go(-1)
        function that takes the user back to the prior page that caused the apology to occur. A convenient
        means of dislaying errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>dump.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Similar to apologize(), dump() returns the literal content of the variable dump()'d wrapped in
        'pre' tags so that it isn't interpreted as html or php at all. We used this primarily for debugging.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>header.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Header is displayed at the top of every page and is rendered by the render() function in functions.php.
        It has the open html tag and head tags. Inside the head tag, we link in our stylesheets using link tags,
        including a 'echo time()' function which prevents the browser from always caching styles.css in case the styling has
        since changed. It then presents our project's title, configures javascript for any page, closes the
        head tag and then inside the body tag we have our logos in as links to our homepages along with serving
        their main purpose of being absolutely beautiful.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>footer.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Footer, like header, is rendered by the render() function. Footer also contains hyperlinks
        that redirect to design.php and documentation.php, where out design and doc pages are. Additionally,
        footer contains our copyright with an HTML special char and a redirect to theboys.php where a picture
        of us creators awaits an unsuspecting user.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>template.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This page contains all the html for our homepage that isn't in header or footer. This includes the
        welcome paragraph (wrapped in a 'p' tag) with occasionally bolded text that we wrapped in 'span' tags
        in order to only make certain regions bolded. After this paragraph, we had a few /br's to seperate our images
        slightly further from the paragraph for aesthetic reasons. The two pictures that follow are wrapped in 'a'
        tags and an href='' attribute that redirects to either compare.php or ideal.php respectively. The images were made
        seperately and their exact pixel width and height (to scale) are specified in attributes of the 'img' tag.
        Finally, a thank you message is displayed at the bottom of the page.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>template2.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Template2 is where a GET request to compare.php leads. Here the user is asked to fill out a
        selecting the two states they wish to compare, the importance of each attribute using sliders (html)
        that have auto-updating numbers beneath the slider (javascript 'script' tags configure) along with
        radio buttons to select whether or not a higher or lower temperature, population, etc is more desirable.
        Once all values are specified, the form submits and a HTTP request with method POST is sent to compare.php
        and template3.php is rendered with the values entered into template2.php's form passed in.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>template3.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>template3 description</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>template4.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Template4 is where a GET request to ideal.php leads. Here the user is asked to fill out a form
        typing in the ideal values for each attribute, hoping to find a state that is a close match (low weighted score)
        Again, the sliders are handled with script tags and javascript to update the numbers beneath the slider
        itself. After a user selects their importance, the form submits and a HTTP request with method POST is
        sent to ideal.php and template5.php is rendered with the values entered into template4.php's form passed in.</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>template5.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>template5 description</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>theboys2.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This page shows the creators of this fine website: The Boys (J.Paul Meyer and Jake Morrisey)</li>
    </ul>
    <li class=bolds>documentation2.php</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This page shows the documentation for our entire project nicely shown with bullet points and headers.</li>
