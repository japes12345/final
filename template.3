    arguments over which state is truly 'better' based on however you define 'better'. In <span class=bolds>Find your Ideal State!</span>
    you can decide how important the given attributes are to you, and what the ideal values of each of those attributes are.
    In short, tell us what you want and we'll give you not only the top state for your preferences, but also every other state 
    ranked in order by compatibility to your preferences. The attributes we are currently using are: <span class=bolds>Population, Area, Average
    Temperature, Median Household Income (2011), and Miles of Coastline!</span> For more information, click here for more info or <span class=bolds>More Info</span> at the bottom of the page.
