    <h1 class=bolds class=toppp>Documentation: How to use State Compare!</h1>
    <p1 class=intro>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of right now, our "State Compare"
        website is intended to be hosted on the CS50 Appliance. In order for a user to properly 
        use our website on the CS50 Appliance through vhosts, they will have to follow
        a few preliminary steps. First, the zipped folder "final", which includes all of our website code,
        will have to be obtained. This zipped folder then needs to be unzipped in such a way that the
        "final" folder is located in vhosts (more specifically located within /home/jharvard/vhosts).
        Then, the user will have to use ensure that all contained folders and files are properly
        readable, writeable, and executable using chmod if necessary.
        
        
        </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, "final" is now inside of a 
        directory called vhosts. The appliance is configured to serve "virtual hosts" (i.e., websites) out of 
        the latter. Specifically, if you visit, say, http://final/ using Chrome inside of the appliance, the appliance 
        is configured to look in ~/vhosts/final/public for that website&#39;s web-accessible files. But for that to work, 
        we also need to associate the appliance&#39;s own IP address with "final" so that it "resolves" via DNS to it. Rather 
        than set up a whole DNS server to do that, we can actually edit a file called hosts in a directory called etc.
        In a terminal window, execute: sudo gedit /etc/hosts in order to run gedit as the appliance&#39;s "superuser" (aka "root") so 
        that you can edit what is otherwise a read-only file. Carefully add this line at the bottom of that file, which will associate 
        "final" with the appliance&#39;s "loopback" address (which won&#39;t ever change): 127.0.0.1 final
        
        </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final step for setup is to construct the
        SQL database that our website requires. Go to http://pset7/phpmyadmin inside the appliance in order to open
        access phpMyAdmin. If login is required, the username is jharvard and the password is crimson. Click on phpMyAdmin&#39;s
        SQL tab. Next, in gedit, open the file in our "final" folder called "states.sql". Copy the entirety of its text into 
        the big blank text box on phpMyAdmin. Then click Go. A greenish banner should appear indicating success.
        In phpMyAdmin&#39;s upper-left corner, there should now be a database called final that includes a table
        called states. The contents of this table should be filled with information on the population, area, temperature, income, and 
        coastline of each state.
        
        </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup for the website should now be complete!
        Go to http://final/ on Google Chrome in the appliance in order to access the website!

    <p1 class=intro>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the header of 
        every page is the State Compare logo and two America images. Clicking on any of
        these will always bring you to the home page of the site. This home page has links
        to the main functions of the site, the 'Compare' page and the 'Ideal' page. It also has
        a brief description of these functions for first-time users.
    </br>
    <p1 class=intro>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Compare allows users to (you guessed it) compare states in different ways. The first way
        we offer is a one on one comparison based on our five main factors. These factors are Population, Area,
        Average Temperature, Median Household Income, and Coastline (any of these factors can easily be omitted by
        inputting an importance of 0). In 'compare' the user first selects two different states. Then, they select their preferences
        (for example, a user might want a higher population but a smaller state, and some coastline, but doesn't
        care how much the median household makes or what the average temperature is). Our website determines which state
        is 'better' in the user's opinion by giving
        each of these factors a 'weight' out of 10 for how important any given factor is to the user. The comparison algorithm takes 
        into account the percent difference between the two different states for each factor.
        If, for example, the
        user wants to compare California and Rhode Island, the massive difference in population and area will blow out
        Rhode Island. Rather than only see that California had more, with the weighted score we can see exactly how much
        more. Finally, once the user submits the 'compare' input form, our
        compare algorithm presents them with a nice table, showing which state 'won' in each category, how many category 'wins'
        each state had (raw score). Finally, the weighted score shows a more accurate outcome of which state, in the user's
        eyes, is 'better' and by how much. 
    </p1>
    </br>
    <p1 class=intro>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, State Compare allows users to find their ideal state. Why only find the best of two
        when you can find the best of all 50 states! Exciting right? 'Ideal' uses the same factors, but lets you
        input an exact target for each factor. For example, if you want to find a state with a population close to
        10,000,000 people, with average size, and an average amount of coastline, that is about 65 degrees on average
        year round, simply enter these values into the input form. Also, you can decide how important each factor is by assigning importance ratings on a scale of 0-10.
        Our algorithm determines which state is best for you based on these ideal values and importance ratings. The output is a table
        listing each state in order of how good of a match they are to your preferences. The output
        is even extremely accessible and easy to understand; each state receives a subrank for each factor, all of which get
        displayed in the same row as the final rank, so the user can understand where the rank comes from. To summarize,
        'compare' (in the red and white stripes) allows users to compare states based on whatever end of the spectrum they
        desire. They can also assign the importance of each attribute, in order to get a comprehensive comparison, outputting which state is
        'better' and by how much. 'Ideal' uses a similar mechanism to rank all 50 states in order to how close they are
        to your given 'ideal' statistics for each attribute. This method also incorporates similar importance ratings. We hope for college students to use our website to settle
        whose home state is the true champion in whatever sense of the word they decide upon.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of every page, links to
        'The Boys' can be seen in the Copyright. This page simply displays the 
        names of the site's two authors and a picture of them. It also displays a short
        thank you message to CS50. This page is really intended just to show
        who created the site.

    <p1 class=intro>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also seen a the bottom of every page are links to 
        'documentation' and 'design'. The 'documentation' link will display the text of this file, outlining
        the site's documentation. The 'design' link will display a similar page outlining the basic design
        of each specific file.
