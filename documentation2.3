<h1 class=bolds class=toppp>Documentation: How to use State Compare!</h1>
<p1 class=intro>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Compare allows users to, you guessed it, compare states in different ways. The first way
    we offer is a one on one comparison based on our five main factors. These factors are Population, Area,
    Average Temperature, Median Household Income, and Coastline (any of these factors can easily be omitted by
    inputting an importance of 0). In 'compare' the user selects whatever they prefer
    (for example, let's say a user wants a higher population but a smaller state, and some coastline, but doesn't
    care how much the median household makes or what the average temperature is). Our website determines which state
    is 'better' in the user's opinion (based on the importance value of each factor that they inputted) by giving
    each of these factors a 'weight' out of 10 for how important this factor is to the user. If, for example, the
    user wants to compare California and Rhode Island, the massive difference in population and area will blowout
    Rhode Island, and rather than only see that California had more, with the weighted score we can get an idea for
    how much a state won by. Finally, once the user has told 'compare' how important each of these attributes is, our
     compare algorithm presents them with a nice table, showing which state 'won' in each category, how many category 'wins'
     each state had (raw score) and finally, the weighted score shows a more accurate outcome of which state, in the user's
     eyes, is 'better' and by how much.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, State Compare allows users to find their ideal state, because why only find the best of two
    when you can find the best of all 50 states! Exciting right? 'ideal' uses the same factors, but lets you
    input an exact target for each factor. For example, if you want to find a state with a population close to
    100,000,000 people, with average size, and an average amount of coastline, that is about 65 degrees on average
    year round, then you simply enter these factors in with whatever importance rating you wish to give, and
    our algorithm determines which state is best for you based on these ideal values and importance ratings. The output
    is even extremely accessible and easy to understand; each state receives a subrank for each factor, all of which get
    displayed in the same row as the final rank, so the user can understand where the rank comes from. So to summarize,
    'compare' (in the red and white stripes) allows users to compare states based on whatever end of the spectrum they
    desire, and on importance of each attribute, in order to get a comprehensive comparison, outputting which state is
    'better' and by how much, and 'ideal' uses a similar mechanism to rank all 50 states in order to how close they are
    to your given 'ideal' statistics for each attribute. We hope for college students to use our website to settle
    whose home state is the true champion in whatever sense of the word they decide upon.
